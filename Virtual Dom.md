1. What is the Virtual DOM, and how does it work in React?
- Virtaul DOM helps to improve performance and enhance userExperience.
     How it works:-
1. Initial Rendering
 - When you first load the React app,React creates a Virtual DOM.
 - This is an in-memory representaion of real DOM.It mirrors the structure of your actual UI(the DOM elements like divs,p..),but is much faster and less resource intensive to work with.
2. State changes & Re-Renders:
 - In React, the UI is updated by changing the components state
 - When a user interscts with the app(eg- clicks the button ),React triggers a re-render of the components that are affected by the change.
3. Reconciliation:
 - React updates the virtual DOM first. It creates a new Virtual DOM tree that that reflects the new state of UI.
 - Then ,React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one to see what has changed.This process is called reconciliation.
 - By doing this,rect figures out which parts of the DOM need to be updated rather than re-rendering the entire UI.
 4. Efficient DOM Updates:
  - After comparing the virtual DOM to the previous version, React calculates the minimal set of changes requierd to update the actual DOM.
  - Only the parts of the UI that have changed are updated, which is far more efficient  than re-rendering the entire page.

Benefit of Vritual DOM:
1. Performance - allows quick comparisons and change the UI.
2. Cross-Browser Compatibility - React app are more consistent acress differnet Browsers
3. Declerative UI- Reactâ€™s model allows developers to focus on describing how the UI should look based on the state, 
    rather than worrying about directly manipulating DOM elements.

2. Explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React.
- In a controlled component, the form element's value is controlled by React state.
- The value of the input is bound to a React state variable,and every time the user interacts with the input,the state gets updated.

 How it Works
- The form element's value is set by React State(via the value prop).
- Any Changes made by user(like typing in an input field) trigger and event handler (onChange),which update sthe state,thus updating the value in the input field
example---------------------------
import React, { useState } from "react";

function ControlledComponent() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setValue(event.target.value);  // Update state with the input value
  };

  return (
    <input 
      type="text" 
      value={value}   // The value of the input is controlled by React state
      onChange={handleChange}  // Update state when input changes
    />
  );
}

Benefits-
1. Predictability - Since the state is sync with input fields, you can easily manipulate the form data.
2. Validation and Manipulation- Easier to add validation or formatting as user input is managed by React
3. Consistency - controlled components give you full control over the form data and are more predictable


   Uncontrolled Components-
- The form element manage its own state internally.
- React does not manage the form element value.
- Instead it access the DOM node directly.
Example----------------

import React, { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert("Input value: " + inputRef.current.value);  // Accessing DOM element directly
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />  {/* Using ref to access the input element */}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

Benefit-
1. Simplicity- No need to manipulate the or validate the input continiously.
2. Performance-

3. How does React handle state management, and when should you use Redux?
- State management is the process of storing, updating and accessing the data that determine the application behaves and renders.
- React provide a built in mecanism for handling state at the componenet level
Example ---------
1. useState Hook:
- React uses the useState hook to manage local state within funtional component.
- This hook allows you to derclare state variable and update them.

const [count,setCount]=useState(0);

return (
    <div>
    <button onClick={()=>setCount(count+1)}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
)

2. useReducer
- allows you to manage state with reducer function 

3. Context API:
- The context API is used to manage global state and provide it to deeply nested components wihhout pop drilling.

- When to use Redux: 
1. Complex State logic:
- When you have complex state logic that spans across multiple components and actions,Redux helps manage this complexity by centralizing state and logic in on place

2. Global State
- If you need to manage global state that needs to be accessed and modified by many components, Redux provides a predictable way to handle this through a single source of truth.

3. Predictability:
- Redux enforces strict unidirectional data flow and immutability, making state changes predictable and easier to debug.

4. What are React hooks? Can you explain useState, useEffect, and useContext with examples?
- React hooks are  the normal JS function that returns peace of JSX.React hooks are function that let you use state and other raect features in fuction components.

      useState-
- useState hook is used to add state to function components.
- It returns an array with two elements;

     useEffect HOOK
- it allows you to perform side effects in your components.
- Side effects could be things like fetching data,subscribing to a service ,updating the DOM etc.
- useEffect runs after every render  by default,but you can control when it runs based on dependencies.
    SYNTAX
     useEffect(()=>{

     },[])
- if you pass an empty array as a second argument,the effect runs once 

     usecontext HOOK

- Allows you to consume a value from a React Context.React Context allows you to share data across multipe components without passing props down manually through every level of the components   tree (known as prop drilling)

   const value=useContext(MyContext;)
